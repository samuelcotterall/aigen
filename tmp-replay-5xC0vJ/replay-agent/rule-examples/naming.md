# Naming

This rule concerns naming conventions.

Example:

- Prefer camelCase for local variables and functions.
- Use PascalCase for exported classes and types.

Do: Use clear, descriptive names like `userProfile` rather than `up`.
Don't: Use single-letter or ambiguous names except for indices in short loops.
