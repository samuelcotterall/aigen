# Documentation site (Docusaurus)

This repo includes a minimal Docusaurus scaffold under `website/` to host project documentation.

Quick start from repo root:

1. Install dependencies for the website (from repo root):

```bash
cd website
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```bash
npm run start
```

3. Build and serve production output:

```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
```

If you prefer to regenerate the scaffold using the official tool, you can run:

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest website classic
```

This will create a `website/` folder; the existing files here provide a minimal, ready-to-run site tailored to the repo.
