# Formatting

This rule concerns code formatting and layout.

Example:

- Keep line length to a readable maximum (e.g., 100 characters).
- Use consistent indentation and trailing commas where the project standard requires them.

Do: Format code with the project's formatter (prettier/biome).
Don't: Commit code with inconsistent indentation or mixed tabs/spaces.
